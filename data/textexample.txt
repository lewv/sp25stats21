I took my love, I took it down. Climbed a mountain and I turned around. And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills. 'Til the landslide brought me down. Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love? Can the child within my heart rise above? Can I sail through the changin' ocean tides? Can I handle the seasons of my life?
